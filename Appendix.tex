This project does not involve direct human participant, while uses personal data from BraTs19 competition collected by Center for Biomedical Image Computing \& Analytics (CBICA). Furthermore, the CBICA dataset used in this project were directly downloaded from the competition. This project only uses the MRI image offered by the competition while it also offering anonymised data about the age and survival of patients. Moreover, although the dataset is officially public, we made sure that we had all the necessary authorizations to use it, and we strictly follow the BCS code and IET rules of conduct.\\
