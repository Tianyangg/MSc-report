\chapter{Background}
%The Background section should describe the background research you have completed in preparation for the work of the project, due on the date given above. You should summarise the essential material related to the subject of the project. There is no minimum or maximum page length, but typical reports are between 10 and 20 pages long. The material in this can be incorporated into the final report.
%
%You should also include a separate section on Progress that describes: the activities and accomplishments of the project to date; any problems or obstacles that might have cropped up and how they are being dealt with; and plans for the next phases of the project.
