\begin{abstract}
The Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) has witness great progress in presence with deep Convolutional Neural Networks, while a large set of carefully labelled data for specific disease for segmentation training is time-consuming and rarely available for public research.\\

In this work, we focus on the medical segmentation task on small sample annotated Covid-19 Lung CT scans. This project investigated two common scenarios: (1) A small set of annotated samples, and (2) A small set of annotated samples with a relative larger unlabeled data. \\

We first evaluated several transfer learning frameworks: Fine tune all, and freezing different layers of encoder in comparison with random initialization for not only the segmentation accuracy, but also the layer-wise difference using SVCCA tool. \\

Then, given the unlabeled data, we further designed a semi-supervise pipeline to improve the generalizability of the model, including iterative psuedo-labeling and Exponential Moving Averaging training. The pipeline improved the accuracy from transfer learning from
