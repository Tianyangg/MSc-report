\section{Motivation}

We here describe the problem setup for this project. The project aims to explore several few shot segmentation methods in medical domain, specifically 3D Lung computed tomography (CT) images. One of the target for this method is to provide solutions to the few shot segmentation challenge proposed in the COVID19 segmentation benchmark\footnote{http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/}. Given this is a relatively small dataset and might not present good evaluation to the result, we also plan to evaluate the performance on Strucseg dataset.
\section{Feasibility}
\section{Challenge}
In non-medical domain, both few shot classification and few shot segmentation has been well explored and provide good performance on some of the segmentation benchmarks. In medical application, few shot learning mainly focus on classification tasks while dense segmentation does not provide promising results as far as we know.\\

We so far beleive the task is doable based on the previous analysis. We aim to implement a method that provide comparable performance compared to U-net, which is a good model on small sample medical image segmentation.
