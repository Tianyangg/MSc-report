We here describe the problem setup for this project. The project aims to explore several few shot segmentation methods in medical domain, specifically 3D Lung computed tomography (CT) images. One of the target for this method is to provide solutions to the few shot segmentation challenge proposed in the COVID19 segmentation benchmark\footnote{http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/}. Given this is a relatively small dataset and might not present good evaluation to the result, we also plan to evaluate the performance on Strucseg dataset.
